# rock_paper_cisors

This is a project I made to train webdevelopment proposed by @theodinproject. the idea is to make an animated page to play rock-paper-cisors.
The font used in the title is Street Explorer made by putracetol studio. 
A shoutout to this guy who taught me how to restart an animation in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut5alGmdFNc&t=419s.
Hope you like it. See live preview here: https://chel0per.github.io/rock_paper_cisors/.
